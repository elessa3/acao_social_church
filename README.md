# acao_social_church

This project is developing for an ONG that helps immigrants in Europe. 

The intention is to organize the current and new beneficiariesâ€™ registrations, the days of food donation, and provide good service according to demand. 

This desktop program allows the following functions:
1- Register/modify/delete new beneficiaries and volunteers, 
2- Schedule a determined number of people per day, 
3- It has validations for duplicate registration and scheduling since each family group can request food assistance once a month.
